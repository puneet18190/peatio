                    <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- When you open an account with a bank or exchange, they create an account for you in their system.</p>
                    <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- The bank keeps track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money.</p>
                      <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- You have an account with the bank or exchange and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit.</p>

                    <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- When you create an account on SAFEWEX you are generating a cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address).</p>
                    <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.</p>
                      <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information.</p>
                      <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- You are simply using our interface to interact directly with the blockchain.</p>

                    <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- The blockchain is like a huge, global, decentralized spreadsheet.</p>
                    <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.</p>
                      <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- It is stored and maintained by thousands of people (miners) across the globe who have special computers.</p>

                    <p class="safewex_lead mb10">Because the point of decentralization and the blockchain is that .</p>
                    <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds.</p>
                      <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- You dont have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe.</p>
                                      <p class="safewex_lead mb10">- If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. ðŸ˜‰</p>
