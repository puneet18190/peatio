                    <h2 class="safe_lead mb10">A Bitcoin wallet is the first step to using Bitcoin.
                    
                    Why?</p>
                    <p class="safe_lead mb10">- You can think of a wallet as your personal interface to the Bitcoin network, similar to how your online bank account is an interface to the regular monetary system.</p>
                      <p class="safe_lead mb10">- Bitcoin wallets contain private keys; secret codes that allow you to spend your bitcoins.
                      
                      In reality, itâ€™s not bitcoins that need to be stored and secured, but the private keys that give you access to them.
                      
                      In short:</p>
                      <p>- A Bitcoin wallet is simply an app, website, or device that manages Bitcoin private keys for you.</p>
